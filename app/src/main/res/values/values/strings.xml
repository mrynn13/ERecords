        This app is created to serve as an assistant for teachers.
        Using the traditional way of listing the score records of students seems outdated and hassle
        since you have to carry some papers. Using our app, you can keep track of your student\'s records
        easily. Using the android phone you have, you can now hold the records of the students wherever you
        are.\n\n
